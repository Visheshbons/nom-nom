            <h2>SKIP THE QUEUE</h2>
            <p>
                Nom Nom is the Year 10 Commerce crew at Hamilton Boys’ High — big shoutout to Mr. Harrison for the coaching.
                We’re <span class="gen-z-slang">lowkey</span> switching up Market Day <span class="gen-z-slang">vibes</span>: the first HBHS team to drop a proper website and let you pre-order, <span class="gen-z-slang">no cap.</span>
                Our cookies, brownies and lemonade? Pure <span class="gen-z-slang">slap</span> — planned, budgeted and baked by us while we do Commerce, so it’s <span class="gen-z-slang">legit</span> student-made.
                Why preorder? Simple — cop your faves, skip the queue, and don’t be the one waiting while everything sells out.
                Pre-order = lock it in, grab it fresh, and flex on your mates who slept. Batches are limited, so FOMO is real — <span class="gen-z-slang">fr</span>, don’t sleep on it.
            </p>

            <p>How it works: (dead easy)</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pick what you want on the menu.</li>
                <li>Pre-order it with the 'preorder' button.</li>
                <li>Choose a pickup time.</li>
                <li>Confirm your order.</li>
                <li>Swing by our stall on Market Day to grab your order — quick and hassle-free.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
                We’re all about making Market Day actually <span class="gen-z-slang">vibey</span> and useful.
                Whether you need a study-break cookie, a brownie to share at lunch, or a cold lemonade after sport, Nom Nom’s got you.
                Support your Boys' High <span class="gen-z-slang">mates</span>, secure the goods, and be part of the first HBHS Market Day that’s gone digital.
                Pre-order now — your future self (and your stomach) will thank you.

The Nom-Nom project is dedicated to:

* Krishh Grover, Muhammad Abdullah, and Logan Norman, as the fellow founders of Nom-Nom.
* I would also like to acknowledge Ian Harrison, for allowing me to make a website for our stall on Market Day 2025.

There are a lot of people who have also helped, but I am too lazy to fit it all in a JS comment, but still, I appreciate it.
